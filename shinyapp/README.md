Run the `run-app.R` script to launch the Shiny App.

This will require R with the following packages:
- shiny
- dplyr
- DT
- ggplot2

A docker with these dependencies will be available soon.

While we prepare the real data, we can prepare the app using dummy data. See the [testdata](testdata) folder.
