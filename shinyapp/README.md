Run the `run-app.R` script to launch the Shiny App.

This will require R with the following packages:
- shiny
- dplyr
- DT
- ggplot2
- shinydashboard

A docker with these dependencies will be available soon.

While we prepare the real data, we can prepare the app using dummy data. See the [testdata](testdata) folder.

## Live version

There must be a way to deploy the app using DNANexus. 
We might also be able to deploy on https://www.shinyapps.io/ for free (for demo purposes). 
In the meantime, there is a version if hosted at http://courtyard.gi.ucsc.edu:3210/
